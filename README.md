# Create a chatbot in python

## Introduction
This Python chatbot is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. It can understand and respond to a variety of user inputs based on patterns and keywords found in the dataset. You can modify the dataset to make the chatbot respond to specific user queries or use more advanced natural language processing libraries for more sophisticated responses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at [source_dataset_link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grafstor/simple-dialogs-for-chatbot).

This Python chatbot project aims to provide a foundation for building conversational AI systems. It showcases the fundamental concepts of natural language processing and chatbot development. Key points to consider:

Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot uses basic keyword matching and rule-based responses. While simplistic, it provides a starting point for understanding how chatbots interpret and respond to user input.

Customization: The provided dataset (responses.json) is easily customizable. You can add, modify, or remove responses to tailor the chatbot's behavior to your specific use case. For more advanced chatbots, you can explore machine learning-based approaches and integrate more extensive datasets.

Learning Opportunity: This project is an excellent learning tool for beginners in chatbot development and natural language processing. It can serve as a stepping stone for those interested in diving deeper into the field and exploring more advanced AI techniques.

Expandability: While this chatbot is relatively simple, it can be extended to include more sophisticated features and capabilities. You can explore integrating external APIs, sentiment analysis, and language translation services to enhance its functionality.

Community Contribution: We encourage contributions from the open-source community. Feel free to submit pull requests, suggest improvements, or share your experiences in the project's issue tracker.

Security and Privacy: When extending the chatbot for real-world applications, consider implementing security measures to protect user data and privacy. Make sure to handle user data responsibly, following best practices and legal requirements.

Documentation: In addition to this README, you can provide detailed documentation in the project's documentation folder or a dedicated wiki. Documenting the chatbot's architecture, code structure, and dataset format can help others understand and contribute to the project.

Demo and Use Cases: Consider including examples of how this chatbot can be used in different scenarios. Whether it's for customer support, FAQs, or general chit-chat, provide use cases to inspire potential users.

This Python chatbot project is designed to be a starting point, and you are encouraged to build upon it to create more robust and capable conversational agents.

## Dependencies

Before you can run the chatbot, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

You can install NLTK using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
